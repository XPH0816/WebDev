## 6.1 Web Design Principles
1. Repetition
   - Repeat visual elements throughout design.
2. Contrast
   - Add visual excitement and draw attention.
3. Proximity
   - Group related items.
4. Alignment
   - Align elements to create visual unity.

## 6.2 User Interface and User Experience
1. User Interface (UI)
   - the screen
   - the elements
   - the color
   - the platform
2. User Experience (UX)
   - The User
   - Takes into consideration things outside the screen
   - The environment, what the user might be doing

### UX/UI Process
1. Who, What, Where, When, Why
   1. Define Goals
2. The Art Design - Visual Magic
3. Data / Observations Make it Scientific

## 6.3 Graphic and Colors
### Representing Digital Images
1. Images on your desktop monitor or your mobile screen are small squares of colored light called **pixels** that are arranged in a two-dimensional grid.
2. In contrast, printed images are not created from pixels, but small overlapping dots usually called **halftones**.

### Raster Images (Bitmap Images, Pixel Images, JPEG, PNG, GIF)
1. In a **raster image** (also called a **bitmap image**), the smaller components are pixels.
2. Each colored square uses a number that represents its color value.
3. Raster images can be manipulated on a pixel-by-pixel basic by programs such Adobe Photoshop, Apple Aperture, Microsfot Paint, or the opensource GIMP.

### Vector images (Scalable Vector Graphics - SVG)
1. **vector image** is composed of objects such as lines, circles, Bezier curves, and polygons.
2. Vector images are resolution independent and can be shrunk or enlarged without a loss of quanlity.
3. Software includes Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Visio, Adobe Animate (formerly Flash), Affinity Designer (Mac only), and the open-source Inkscape.

#### Resizing raster images versus vector images
| Raster Images | Vector Images |
|---------------|---------------|
| Enlarging a raster image can cause it to become blurry. | Vector images can be enlarged without loss of quality. |
| Shrinking a raster image can cause it to lose detail. | Shrinking a vector image does not cause it to lose detail. |

### Color Models
1. There are many ways to describe color in web development.
   1. Names Colors
   2. RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
   3. CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)
   4. HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)

#### RGB
1. relies on the fact that human visible color spectrum can be displayed using a combination of red, green, and blue light.
2. Each pixel is composed of tiny red, green, and blue subpixels.
3. RGB colors combine to create white, they are called **additive colors**.

#### CMYK
1. CMYK colors are used in printing.
2. Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black color is created through overlapping cyan, magenta, yellow, and black dots that create the illusion of the combined color called **subtractive colors**.

#### HSL
1. HSL is more closely aligned to the way we generally talk about color.
2. It breaks a color down into three components:
   1. **Hue** - (What we generally refer to as color)
   2. **Saturation** - (the intensity of the color)
   3. **Lightness** - (or Brightness)

#### Opacity in CSS
1. **Opacity** is the degree of transparency in the color. (also referred to as **alpha transparency**)
2. In CSS, there is an opacity property that takes a value between 0 and 1.
   1. 0 means that the element  is fully transparent.
   2. 100 means that the element is fully opaque - that is, it has no transparency.

#### Gradients
1. A **gradient** is a transition between two or more colors.
2. Gradients use the **background-image** property.

#### Image concepts
1. There are a number of other concepts that you should be familiar with in order to fully understand digital media.
2. Color Depth
   1. Dithering
3. Image Size
   1. Interpolating
4. Display Resolution

##### Color Depth
1. **Color depth** refers to the maximum number of possible colors that an image can contain.
2. For raster images, this value is determined by the number of bits used to represent the color or tone information for each pixel.
3. The more bits used to represent color, the more possible colors an image can contain.
4. 8-bit color depth can represent 256 colors.
5. 24-bit (true color) = 16.8 million colors.
6. Most LCD monitors are only 18-bit displays devices (262,144 colors) and use **dithering** to create the illusion of more colors.

#### Image Size
1. **Image size** refers to how many pixels a raster image contains the size of an image onscreen is determined by
   1. Pixel dimensions of the image
   2. Monitor size, and the 
   3. Computer's display resolution.
2. Whenever you resize, the program (the browser, Photoshop, etc) doing the resizing must **interpolate**

##### Interpolation and Resizing
1. Resizing an image always reduces its quanlity
2. You can resize in the browser but be cautious.
3. You will get better results if you enlarge images in a dedicated image editing program.
4. Large images, scaled down in the browser use unnecessary bandwidth.

#### Display Resolution
1. **Display resolution** refers to how many pixels a devices can display.
2. Some common display resolutions include 1920 x 1600, 1280 x 1024, 1024 x 768, and 320 x 480 px.
3. Web page will appear smaller on a high-resolution system (and larger on a low-resolution system).
4. File formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG and WebP are used to display images on the web.

### JPEG
1. **JPEG** (Joint Photographic Experts Group) or JPG is a 24-bit, true-color image format that is ideal for photographic images.
2. It uses a compression scheme to reduce the file size (and hence download time) of the image.
3. JPEG is quite poort for vector art or diagrams or any image with a large area of a single color.
4. At the highest levels of compression, you will begin to see blotches and noise (also referred to as artifacts)

### GIF
1. **GIF** (Graphics Interchange Format) file was the first image format supported by the earliest web browsers.
2. GIF is an 8-bit or less format, meaning that it can contain no more than 256 colors!
3. GIF uses a lossless compression system, which means that no pixel information is lost.
4. The compression system, is called **runlength compression** (also called **LZW compression**).
5. GIF file format uses indexed color
6. 8 bits (or fewer) dedicated to each color pixel in the image.
7. Those 8 bits for each pixel reference (or index) a color that is described in a **color palette**.

#### Transparency in GIF
1. GIF has 1-bit transparency.
2. A pixel is either fully transparent or fully opaque.
3. **Anti-aliasing** "smoothing" along boundary edges often result in a "halo" of colo. Formats like png can address this issue.

### PNG
1. The **PNG** (Portable Network Graphics)
2. Lossless compression
3. 8-bit (or 1-bit, 2-bit, and 4-bit) indexed color as well as full 24-bit true color.
4. From 1 to 8 bits of **transparency**.

### SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
1. **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an *vector* format.
2. Like all vector formats, SVG graphics do not lose quanlity when enlarged or reduced.
3. The files are actually XML files.

### Other Image
1. The **TIF** (Tagged Image File Format) is a cross-platform lossless image format especially useful to print professionals.
2. **WebP** is a new image format promoted by Google. It supports *both* lossy and lossless compression, and Google claims WebP compression results are superior in comparison to JPG or PNG formats. Loessles WebP also supports transparency. At the time of writing, however, Safari and iOS does not support this format.
3. **ICO** is another web file format (.ico) whose sole use is for favicons.

## 6.4 Multimedia
### Audio and Video
1. Before HTML5, adding audio or video to a web page typically required making use of additional plug-ins, often Adobe Flash/
2. With HTML5 you can add these media features in HTML withou the involvement of any plug-in.
   - Unfortunately, the browsers do not support the same list of media formats, so browser incompatibilities are still a problem with audio and video.

### Media Concepts
1. There are a **lot** of different audio and video formats. While we won't cover them all, two concepts are essential to understanding media formats.
2. **Media encoding** - Media is compressed / and encoded using a codec.
   - **Codec** (for compression/decompression) software used to encode the media. There are literally thousands of codecs.
3. **Container formats** A container is similar in concept to ZIP files: both are compressed file formats that contain other content. There is a large number of container formats.

### Browser Video Support
1. **MP4 container with H.264 video codec and AAC audio**. This combination is generally referred to as **MPEG-4** and has the **.mp4** or **.m4v** file extension. H.264 is a proprietary codec and the browser manufacturer must pay a licensing fee to decode it.
2. **WebM container with VP8 video codec and Vorbis audio**. This combiniation usually have the **.webm** file extension. This combination was created by Google to be open-source and royalty-free.
3. **Ogg container with Theora video codec and Vorbis audio**. This combination usually has the **.ogv** file extension. Theora and Vorbis are open-source and royalty-free.

#### Using the video element
1. Due to varying browser support, you will need to serve more than one type. Thankfully, HTML5 makes this a reasonably painless procedure.
```html
<video controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="movie.ogv" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
### Browser Audio Support
1. **MP3**. Both a container format and a codec. It is patented and requires browser manufacturers to pay licensing fees. Usually has the **.mp3** file extension.
2. **WAV**. Also a container and a codec. Usually has the **.wav** file extension.
3. **OGG**. Container with Vorbis audio. Open-source. Usually has the **.ogg** file extension.
4. **Web**. Container with Vorbis audio. Open-source. Usually has the **.webm** file extension.
5. **MP4**. Container with AAC audio. Requires licensing fees. Usually has the **.mp4** file extension.

#### Using the audio element
As with video, if you intend to provide audio in your pages, you will need to serve more than one type.
```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <source src="song.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
```

## 6.5 Navigation   
### Navigation Design
1. Make your site easy to navigate
   1. Provide clear navigation in the same location on each page
   2. Most common - across top or down left side
2. Consider:
   1. Navigation bars
   2. Breadcrumb Navigation
   3. Using Graphics for Navigation
   4. Dynamic Navigation
   5. Site Map
   6. Site Search Feature
   7. "Skip to Content" Hyperlink

## 6.6 Responsive Web Design
1. **Responsive Web Design** is about **creating web pages that look good on all devices!**
2. A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
3. Using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
4. Free and Easy way **Frameworks**
5. Two popular CSS Frameworks offer Responsive Design
   1. W3.CSS
   2. Bootstrap

## 6.7 Creating Graphics
1. GD is an open source PHP library for **dynamic creation of images**.
2. GD is used for creating PNG, JPEG, GIF and Bitmap images.
3. It is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails.
4. GD library allows alteration, manipulation, and creation of images through programming such as:
   1. Create new images
   2. Create text
   3. Manipulate image
   4. Manipulate text 

### Steps
| Steps | Syntax and example |
|-------|--------------------|
| Image type | Syntax: `header('Content-Type: image/(png/gif/jpg)');` |
| | Example: `header('Content-Type: image/png');` |
| Image dimension | Syntax: `imagecreate(width, height);` |
| | Example: `imagecreate(400, 200);` |
| Creation command | Syntax: `imagepng(image_stream)` |
| | Example: `imagepng($image);` |
| Deletion command | Syntax: `imagedestroy(image_stream)` |
| | Example: `imagedestroy($image);` |

```php
<?php
  header('Content-Type: image/png');
  $image = imagecreate(400, 200);
  // Set the background color
  $whiteBG = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
  // save the image as png and output
  imagepng($image);
  // Clear up memory used
  imagedestroy($image);
?>
```
### Creating Text
1. **imagestring(*image_stream*, *size*, *Xcoordinate*, *Ycoordinate*, *string*, *color*)**
2. Example:
```php
<?php
  header('Content-Type: image/png');
  $image = imagecreate(400, 200);
  $whiteBG = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
  $black = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 0, 0);
  imagestring($image, 5, 100, 100, 'Hello World', $black);
  imagepng($image);
  imagedestroy($image);
?>
```

### Creating Text with TrueType Fonts
1. **imagettftext(*image_stream*, *size*, *angle*, *Xcoordinate*, *Ycoordinate*, *color*, *font*, *string*)**
2. If bitmap font made larger or smaller than it was intended to be, it looked horrible.
3. Apple developed the font technology, TrueType based on achievement of Adobe Type 1 font.
4. Example:
```php
<?php
  header('Content-Type: image/png');
  $image = imagecreate(400, 200);
  $whiteBG = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
  $txt_color = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 0, 0);
  $font = 'arial.ttf';
  imagettftext($image, 20, 0, 10, 100, $txt_color, $font, 'Hello World');
  imagepng($image);
  imagedestroy($image);
?>
```

### Creating Lines
1. **imageline(*image_stream*, *X1*, *Y1*, *X2*, *Y2*, *color*)**
2. Example:
```php
<?php
  header('Content-Type: image/png');
  $image = imagecreate(125, 125);
  $whiteBG = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
  $black = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 0, 0);
  imageline($image, 0, 0, 400, 200, $black);
  imagepng($image);
  imagedestroy($image);
?>
```

### Creating an ellipse
1. **imageellipse(*image_stream*, *Xcenter*, *Ycenter*, *width*, *height*, *color*)**
2. Example:
```php
<?php
  header('Content-Type: image/png');
  $image = imagecreate(200, 200);
  $whiteBG = imagecolorallocate($image, 255, 255, 255);
  $black = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 0, 0);
  imageellipse($image, 100, 100, 150, 150, $black);
  imagepng($image);
  imagedestroy($image);
?>
```

### Creating Bar Charts
1. Simply a **series of rectangles** that represent the unit or percentage amount of a maximum value, starting from a logical 0 point and proceeding to the specified amount of the maximum value with a constant bar width. 
2. Bar chart requires the following:
   1. Image type
   2. Data to plot
   3. Image dimension (canvas size)
   4. Background color (canvas color)
   5. X and Y axis (line and color)
   6. Graph bar fill color
   7. First graph bar location
   8. Width and height of each graph bar
   9. Data plot
   10. Creation command
3. Example:
```php
<?php
    //Step1: Set the correct content type 
    header('content-type: image/jpeg');
    $data = array("3000","2470","225","663","6666","3456","789");
    //echo $data[0];

    $height = 255;
    $width = 320;
    $image = imagecreate($width,$height);
    $white = imagecolorallocate($image, 240, 240, 255);
    $black = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 0, 0);
    imageline($image, 10, 5, 10, 230, $black);
    imageline($image, 10, 230, 300, 230, $black);
    $blue = imagecolorallocate($image, 0, 64, 128);
    $x = 15; //start from left
    $y = 230; //start from bottom
    $x_width = 20; //width of each bar
    $y_ht = 0; //height of each bar
    $sum = array_sum($data); //sum of all data

    for($i=0; $i<7; $i++)
    {
        $y_ht = ($data[$i]/$sum)*$height; //height of each bar
        imagefilledrectangle($image, $x, $y, $x+$x_width, ($y-$y_ht), $blue); //draw bar on image
        imagestring($image, 2, $x-1, $y+10, $data[$i], $black); //display data on top of bar
        $x += ($x_width + 20); //move to next bar location (20 is the gap between bars)
    }

    imagejpeg($image);
    imagedestroy($image);
?>
```
