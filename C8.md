## 8.1 Current Application and Technology
1. Voice Search
2. WebAssembly
3. Content Personalization Through Machine Learning
4. Data Security
5. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)
6. Multi-experience
7. Motion UI

### Voice Search
1. Voice search is one of the main trends in e-commerce. It is a technology that allows users to search the web using voice commands instead of typing.

### WebAssembly
1. WebAssembly aims for native-like performance among web apps. With WebAssembly, the code in any programming language can be compiled into bytecode that runs in a browser.

### Content Personalization Through Machine Learning
1. Machine learning-based personalization provides a more scalable and accurate way to achieve unique experiences for individual users. Rather than segmenting users with rule based personalization, it allows you to utilize algorithms in order to deliver these one-to-one experiences.

### Web Security
1. **Stolen data**. From email addresses to payment information, cybercriminals frequently go after visitor or customer data stored on a site.
2. **Phishing schemes**. Phishing doesn't just happen in email - some attacks take the form of web pages that look legitimate but are designed to trick user into providing sensitive information.
3. **Session hijacking**. Some cyberattacks can take over a user's session and force them to take unwanted actions on a site.
4. **Malicious redirects**. Certain attacks can redirect visitors from the site they intended to visit to a malicious website.
5. **SEO Spam**. Unusual links, pages, and comments can be put on a site to confuse your visitors and drive traffic to malicious websites.

### Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)
1. A progressive Web Application, or PWA, unites the advantages of both web and mobile apps into a single software product.
2. As Google declares, PWAs are "UX that have the reach of the web and are reliable, fast, and engaging."
3. AMP is a web component framework to easily create user-first experiences for the web.

### PWA VS AMP
1. AMPs are open-source libraries that ensure the web pages loading in a fast manner while PWA uses optimized ways to deliver a native app-like experience to users.
2. AMPs load very fast every time, though PWAs shows a bit delay in first time loading. But further loading happens it provides a fast experience because of cache.
3. PWAs are not accepted universally on all platforms, so it will show minor inconveniences when they're shown on iOS. They still do not support all the functionality of the hardware, such as Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, or accelerometers. 
4. AMPs are supported by all major browsers on all platforms.
5. AMPs has a considerable law engagement when the pages get loaded in the browser while PWAs show high involvement.

### Multi-experience
1.  Multi-experience is about leveraging various modalities, digital touchpoints, apps, and devices to design and develop a seamless experience for users.
2.  The idea is to interact with the customers at as many touch points as possible to offer a consistent customer experience across the web, mobile, app, and other modalities. 

### Motion UI
1. A front-end framework used for building fully responsive web designed apps.
2. The Motion UI provides developers the staple medium for creating motion within a native app setting.
3. The Motion UI includes predefined motions that are easily accessible and can be put to use for any project.

## 8.2 E-commerce integration
1. E-commerce integration is the coordination between a business eCommerce website and their back-end systems, such as an ERP or CRM system.
2. Efficient eCommerce integration creates accurate sales data through automated, real-time inventory updates in separate systems.

## 8.3 Issues for Web Security
1. **Malware**
   1. catch-all phrase for any software designed to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorized access to a system.
   2. There are many ways malware can spread, from plugging in infected USB drives to accidental downloads from infected website.
   3. Viruses, spyware and 'worms' are typically included in the definition of malware.
2. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   1. XSS is a type of security vulnerability hackers use to bypass security features by injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
   2. While it has been around for a long time (for something on the internet anyway), ZDnet reported in 2017 that it still represents a major threat vector - so much so that many major companies have major companies have bug bounty programs that cover XSS.
3. SQL Injection
   1. An SQL injection occurs when a website form does not protect against special characters and commands, allowing a malicious party to access, change or delete data from the database.
4. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
   1. MITM attacks where a third party intercepts messages between two entities that believe they are communicating with each other.
   2. For example, an end-user browser and a web server.
   3. This is similar to eavesdropping to get critical and private data such as passwords, and credit card information.

## 8.4 Web Accessibilities and Standards
1. W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) develops international Web standards: HTML, CSS, and many more.
2. C's Web standards are called W3C Recommendations.
3. All W3C standards are reviewed for accessibility support by the the Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group (APA WG).
4. The W3C standards and Working Group Notes introduced below are particularly relevant to accessibility.
